Following the tutorial linked above
The main objective of this tutorial was to simply learn how a dynamic web-application looks, as well as understand the code behind it. This project sort of accomplished it. Stack Overflow was a huge help in understanding different bits of code that are used in express and all the other packages. Having never used these packages, it made building this site difficult, as we were expected to use functions that don't exist in nodeJs. The project was simply too large to do as a first project. I think perhaps a smaller project might have been a good start, as this tutoiral requires you to completely understand each prerequisite before moving on. This project gave me a decent understanding of how MVC works, and I understand (to an extent) how each file works with the site as a whole. Future web projects will still be difficult, but I now have something to reference. I certainly understand more than I did a few weeks ago
